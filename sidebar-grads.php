			<p>Nearly every term, students graduate from the Portland State Graphic Design program and throw an awesome event that we call FRESH. This is an opportunity for recent grads to meet professionals working in the field, show off their work, and make connections with the community.</p>
            <p>This term’s designers are all about seeing and being seen. We are strong, sophisticated, and on our way to the top of our game. Countless hours of planning, iteration, and fabrication has led to this moment. There’s no hiding anymore&mdash;it’s time for us to strut our stuff!</p>
