## 11-28-2016 (VER. 1.0) FINAL FALL 2016 FRESH

### Added
- Snowflake script onto the header/banner image using ‘canvas’. -BP

- Added: color: white and line-height: 1.75em to .website_btn in style.css, line 854 (it's better to make the whole 'view website' button clickable instead of just the link inside the div. I went ahead and deleted all the divs around the links, too). - Thom’s Changes

- Added: background-position: center center; to canvas in style.css, line 18. (center the main banner image) - Thom’s Changes

- Commented out: height: 500px on .grad_img in style.css, line 444  (we shouldn't set height on this image because it has a max-width on smaller screens) - Thom’s Changes

- Commented out: width: 375px on .previous_grads p in media_queries.css, line 52 (it was going off the page on small screens) - Thom’s Changes

- Commented out: width: 500px on .previous_grads in style.css, line 1080 - Thom’s Changes

### Fixed

- Changed snowflake to a lighter script due to bugginess and overload on browser. Experiencing lagging, glitches, and slowness.

- Adjusted responsiveness for iPad view, collapsed everything down to one column on landscape/portrait view on 1024px width or less.

### Changed

- Experiencing button difficulties on Vivian’s website button.
- Swapped out Vivian’s text updated per her request.
