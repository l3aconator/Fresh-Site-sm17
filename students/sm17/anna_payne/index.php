    <h1>Anna <span>Payne</span></h1>
    <p>I design to save the world, to support my glamorous apartment-dwelling lifestyle, and to make a better life for my 2 cats. I’m interested in pattern design, packaging, logos, and so much more! Find my table at Fresh and I’ll tell you all about it.</p>
    <p><strong>(Q1) If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />Shamelessly flirting with models who are way out of my league.</p>
    <p><strong>(Q2) My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />My military-style shirt that’s covered in meaningful and meaningless pins/patches alike.</p>
    <p><strong>(Q3) The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />Queen, “Don’t Stop Me Now”</p>
